## Jets Project

### Week 3 Homework for Skill Distillery

### Overview
Created a fleet of jets with different capabilities. The application has a menu to use your jets and access information about them.

All jets have a model, speed, range, and price associated with them. Speed is in MPH, but Jets can also output the speed in mach.

Jets have a fly() method that prints out the jet details and the amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).

Jet itself is an abstract base class. Its purpose it to be extended by other types with different behavior.

Two interfaces for specializations of Jets. For example, CargoCarrier have a loadCargo() method (which just prints out a message about loading cargo). CombatReadyhave a method fight().
